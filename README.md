variables = variable_service.get_variables(SURVEY_ID)
print(variables)

# Responses
response_service = ResponseService(client)
all_responses = response_service.get_all_responses(SURVEY_ID)
new_responses = response_service.get_responses_after(SURVEY_ID, last_index=100)
recent_responses = response_service.get_responses_since(SURVEY_ID, "2025-01-01T00:00:00+03:30")

# Folders
folder_service = FolderService(client)
folders = folder_service.list_folders()
print(folders)
